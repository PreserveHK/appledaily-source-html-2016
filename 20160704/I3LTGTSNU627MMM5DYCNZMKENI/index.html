Suddenly a hand took hold of the valise and a pleasant voice said,  "Pretty heavy, brother! Suppose you let me take one. I am going your way."<br>The African American resisted, but finally allowed the young white man to assist him in carrying his burden, and for several blocks they walked along, chatting like old cronies.<br>And that, said Booker Washington years later, when he had become a dominant leader in the African-American community, was the first time he had ever seen Theodore Roosevelt, who in  1901 became the  26th president of the United States.<br>十九世紀末葉，一天晚上，美國一名黑人在紐約第四十二街上，從巴士總站往旅館走去，手裏拿着一個沉重手提箱，以及一個更加沉重的旅行箱。忽然有人用手執着那旅行箱，親切的說：「兄弟，重得很啊，我給你拿一件吧，反正同路。」<br>那黑人不肯，但終於接受那年輕白人援手，減輕重負。他們一起走了幾個街區，一路像老朋友般交談。<br>多年之後，布克．華盛頓成為美國黑人一位重要領袖。他說，那是他第一次見到西奧多．羅斯福：羅斯福一九零一年成為美國第二十六任總統。</p></body></html>
