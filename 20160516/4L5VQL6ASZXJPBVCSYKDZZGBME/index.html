A Dutch merchant, who was pro-Republic, called on him, and gave him a list of Orangists, or supporters of the royal Dutch family, who had soldiers quartered on them, though in his opinion not in sufficient numbers. He wished that Pichegru should have their houses filled with troops.<br>"I am obliged to you for this information," said Pichegru,  "and have they sent you any soldiers?"  "Yes, general."  "How many?"  "Four."  "That will do." The merchant had no sooner returned home, than 40 more soldiers arrived, and took possession of his house. He hastened back to the general, and said some mistake had taken place.  "Oh no," said Pichegru,  "I only removed my men from those vile Organists, to place them in your house, where I am sure they will be received hospitably."<br>法國革命戰爭名將皮含格呂一七九四年攻佔荷蘭馬斯垂克市，要找房屋給將士投宿，頗不容易。一個主張共和政體的荷蘭商人往謁，呈上支持荷蘭王室的奧蘭治黨人名單，說雖有將士寄宿他們家中，但人數很少，請皮含格呂盡量多派手下去投宿。<br>皮含格呂說：「謝謝先生的情報。他們可有送將士到府上？」「有，將軍。」「多少人？」「四人。」「好。」那商人才回到家裏，就有四十個軍人前來下榻。他連忙再去見皮含格呂，說一定是弄錯了。皮含格呂說：「啊，沒有錯。我只是把將士從邪惡的奧蘭治黨人家中，調到府上，深信他們會獲得殷勤招待。」</p></body></html>
