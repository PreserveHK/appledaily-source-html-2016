However, by some inadvertency a portion of the same land was afterwards granted to the Corporation of New Orleans.<br>Lafayette was advised by eminent lawyers to bring forward his claim, to which the gallant Frenchman replied,  "The land was gratuitously bestowed on me by Congress. I cannot for a moment think of entering into litigation with any public body in the United States."<br>On the tract that Lafayette relinquished was built the City of New Orleans.<br>法國軍官拉法埃脫曾先後參與美國獨立戰爭與法國大革命，功勳彪炳，因有「新舊世界之英雄」美譽*。一八零三年，美國國會贈以一萬一千五百二十英畝土地。但是，由於某方疏忽，這幅地有一部分後來許與新奧爾良公司。<br>有著名律師勸拉法埃脫申明其所有權。但是，這位法國俠客說：「那幅地本由國會惠賜，我決不會為之而向美國的公立機構興訟。」<br>拉法埃脫放棄的那幅地，後來建成新奧爾良市。<br>*美國獨立戰爭時，拉法埃脫率法軍相助，與華盛頓成為朋友。一七八九年，法國國民議會成立，拉法埃脫根據美國《獨立宣言》草成《人民與公民權利宣言》。</p></body></html>
