While the king was conversing with him, Lord Balcarras, a stately old nobleman who had fought in the campaigns of America, was presented. The king introduced them with:  "Lord Balcarras--General Arnold."<br>"What, sire," said the old earl, drawing up his lofty form,  "the traitor Arnold!" and refused to give him his hand. The consequence was a challenge from Arnold.<br>They met, and it was arranged that the parties should fire together. At the signal Arnold fired. Lord Balcarras, however, throwing down his pistol, turned on his heel, and was walking away, when Arnold called after him,  "Why don't you fire, my Lord?"<br>"Sir," said the earl,  "I will leave that to the executioner."<br>美國獨立戰爭之後不久，本尼迪．阿諾德*在倫敦上朝晉見國王。國王和他交談的時候，巴爾卡拉斯伯爵也來晉見：這個身材高大的老貴族，曾在美國參戰。國王給兩人介紹：「這位是巴爾卡拉斯伯爵，這位是阿諾德將軍。」<br>巴爾卡拉斯一挺昂藏之軀，說道：「什麼，是賣國賊阿諾德嗎！」他不肯和阿諾德握手，阿諾德於是邀他決鬥。<br>他們來到決鬥地點，雙方安排同時開槍，開槍信號一發，阿諾德就開火，巴爾卡拉斯卻把手槍擲到地上，轉身離去。阿諾德在後面叫道：「伯爵，為什麼不開火？」<br>巴爾卡拉斯回答說：「老兄，這個由劊子手做吧。」<br>*阿諾德本為美軍將領，後變節投英軍。</p></body></html>
